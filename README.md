# Radar-thickness-detection
Radar thickness detection, which is a way to use a small world simulation algorithm. We can clearly know what is the signal of the radar to be emitted and how much signal is received.  Then the process simulation or the thickness obtained is consistent with the real thickness. I call this method the small world simulation method
